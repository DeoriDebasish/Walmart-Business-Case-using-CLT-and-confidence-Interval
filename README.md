## About Walmart
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

## Business Problem
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

## About the Dataset
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday.
- User_ID               :	User ID
- Product_ID            :	Product ID
- Gender                :	Sex of User
- Age                   :	Age in bins
- Occupation            :	Occupation(Masked)
- City_Category         :	Category of the City (A,B,C)
- StayInCurrentCityYears:	Number of years stay in current city
- Marital_Status        :	Marital Status
- ProductCategory       :	Product Category (Masked)
- Purchase              :	Purchase Amount

## Solution Approach
- Perfroming uniavariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, looking for outliers and missing values.
- We will predict the population mean of average purchase done by both males and females using central limit theorem with varying confidence.
- We will also see the how the predicted population mean changes with varying confidence and varying sample sizes.
- We will predict the population mean of average purchase based on marital status using central limit theorem and observe how the predicted population mean changes with varying confidence and sample sizes.
